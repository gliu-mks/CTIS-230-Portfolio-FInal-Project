    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The last time I went hiking was probably in elementary school at Pilot Mountain with my family. After my brother and I grew up a bit, outings weren't as popular with my family. But as soon as the opportuniry arose to go hiking with some school friends, I was ecstatic. We decided to go to Hanging Rock, which is just an hour away from us in Danbury.</p>

    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When we got there I realized how cold it was. Although I was wearing three layers of shirts and pants, I couldn't stop shivering as we walked down our first trail to a small waterfall. I clutched my Thermos of hot tea for the little warmth it had. When we reached the waterfall, I was already taken aback. It was a small waterfall, but the beauty of the scenery was something I somehow didn't expect. Luckily for my weak stamina, we took a break there to take pictures and listen to the falling water.</p>

    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As we continued to trek up the mountain, I realized how big of an undertaking hiking really would be for me. The steep trail had me out of breath (but thankfully not sweaty thanks to the biting cold). I'm grateful that my friends were generous enough to let us stop a few times on the way. We met a lot of dogs thanks to that!!</p>

    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I really enjoyed taking pictures along the way. We stopped again and again to take silly pictures, like this one imitating "Wanderer above the Sea of Fog" by Caspar David Friedrich. Now closer to the infamous peak, my friends and I saw small signs that encouraged hikers to "keep going!"</p>
