    <h3>BLOG - SUMMER 2024</h3>

    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I brought my camera to Governor's School knowing already that I wanted to capture this almost life-changing month. This frog was the first thing I captured on the Greensboro College campus, where this summer program was held. One evening, on a walk with new friends, I heard the ribbits of a frog coming from the fountain. Surely enough, we found the frog camouflaged among the rocks and crowded it to take pictures.</p>

    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Going on these evening walks quickly became one of my favorite parts of Governor's School. We'd talk about our experiences within and outside of the program and I got to know this new group of people I'm proud to call my friends. This day, while dropping off some friends at their dorm, we encountered a stunning sunset. With everyone stopping to take a picture I suddenly said, "Wait--just stay there." And through the sound of cascading laughs, I took this picture of one our first sunsets.</p>
