    <h3>BLOG - SUMMER 2024</h3>

    <p>I brought my camera to Governor's School knowing already that I wanted to capture this nearly life-changing month. This frog was the first thing I captured on the Greensboro College campus, where this summer program was held. One evening, on a walk with new friends, I heard the ribbits of a frog coming from the fountain. Surely enough, we found the frog camouflaged among the rocks and crowded it to take pictures.</p>

    <p>Going on these evening walks quickly became one of my favorite parts of Governor's School. We'd talk about our experiences within and outside of the program and I got to know this new group of people I'm proud to call my friends. This day, while dropping off some friends at their dorm, we encountered a stunning sunset. With everyone stopping to take a picture I suddenly said, "Wait--just stay there." Shocking, I know. And through the sound of cascading laughs, I took this picture of one our first sunsets.</p>

    <p>Instead of practicing the violin like I was there to do, I would often spend my free time doing not-so academic activities. Some free periods were spent playing games--Roblox in the library was a fan favorite. I remember this specific game was hard to navigate because the sun made it impossible to see the already dark screen. Having not played before, I learned a lot about the variety of games they offer, but I think it's still maybe not for me...</p>

    <img src="/CTIS-230-Portfolio-FInal-Project/images/bgrass.png" height="200px" alt="Governor's School West Volleyball 2024">
    <p>There were outdoor activities prepared for us every day--from spike ball to badminton and soccer to volleyball and more, the possibilities were endless. For someone who hadn't touched a ball in over a year, these activities weren't uber appealing at first glance. During the first volleyball competition, I just sat in a circle with others watching the competitors fight for bragging rights. But I soon found enjoyment in these games, especially in the leisurely "picnic volleyball." Although I absolutely sucked at it, I found that doing things with friends is always fun.</p>

    <p>As the final day of the program approached, our days were filled with final projects, but not just working on them. Some things we were required to go watch, like the dance and choir performances, and the orchestra performance, which I took part in as a student of the Instrumental Music program. For others, space was limited, and we could attend on our own time. Of course, I went to all of them. I went to see science and math presentations, performative arts, and interactive exhibits. An interesting project we saw in the arts was one about environmental awareness. We sorted trash and recyclables and watched as our own waste filled up with others'. My favorite part was the handmade stamp print we got at the end.</p>

    <p>In the end, I definitely didn't take as many pictures as I wanted, but I'm still able to fondly remember the moments we shared. And hopefully, the pictures I <em>did</em> take will help others to do the same.</p>
