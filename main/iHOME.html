    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

		<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My interest in photography began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using my mom's camera, taking pictures helped me to discover a new perspective and changed the way I saw the world. <br>
           <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While I enjoy taking pictures of nature--animals, plants, landscapes--acting as a school photographer expanded my interests, and I find now that taking portraits is something that brings me immense joy. Since the summer of 2024, I have regularly taken photos for things like personal events and senior portraits. <br>
           <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Seeing the people around me smile from the moments I have captured is so rewarding, and I hope to continue pursing my hobby alongside whatever else greets me in my future. </p>
