    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

		<p>My interest in photography began during the COVID-19 pandemic. It took some time to learn the basics; from using the "take a picture" button to learning about ISO, aperture, and shutter speed, I found great interest in learning how to better my skills, even if they weren't the most impressive. Now I realize, taking pictures helped me to discover a new perspective of the world.<br>
           <br>While I enjoy taking pictures of nature--animals, plants, landscapes--acting as a school photographer expanded my interests, and I find now that taking portraits is something that brings me immense joy. Since the summer of 2024, I have regularly taken photos for things like personal events and senior portraits. Seeing the people around me smile from the moments I have captured is so rewarding, and I hope to continue pursing my hobby alongside whatever else greets me in my future. </p>
